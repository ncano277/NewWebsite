Trinity campus is known for its 166-Foot Murchison Tower, which previously was the highest point in San Antonio. The campus is beautiful due to its abundance of trees and greenery. When walking around, you will most likely run into one of the trinicats, which can be found all over campus. </p>

<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the academic rigor and small class sizes. I like the liberal arts aspect of the school that lets me experience learning new things in all areas. </p></br>



<p>I chose Trinity University because of its academic prestige, as well as its proximity to home for me. More specifically, the type of education, as well as the type of connections i will receive from Trinity can not be matched by any other school in the country. </p>

<p>I am thinking of majoring in Business Administration, with a minor in sports management, because i would love to work around the sports industry in any capacity as it is something i am interested in.. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
